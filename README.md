# Burger App

## Description & Usage
 The purpose of this app is to display a submission box with a submit button where the user can input a type of burger they would like. Once submitted, the burger is displayed on the left hand side, along with a button that says "devour". When the user presses the "devour" button, the burger they chose will be moved to the right hand side and marked as "devoured". This app is designed to implement full stack practices, including MySql, Node, Javascript, HTML, Handlebars, and CSS.
